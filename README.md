# Project Postal Code

This small project was made for the c module at the IUT Nancy-Charlemagne (2020-2021).
It aims to sort cities according to their postal code using linked lists.


### Installation
Use the makefile commande `make` to create the executable `main`.
```bash
make
```

### Usage
A path for a file formatted as [city_name postal_code] on each line needs to be given as parameter.
```bash
./main [source_file]
```
